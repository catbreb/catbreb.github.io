    <h2>Leon Thomas</h2>

    <p class="about">Hello! I'm Leon! I am a disabled queer artist in the Dallas area. I have a background in theatre,
        art,
        technology, and special needs. I enjoy making art that is evocative and makes people uncomfortable - blending
        grotesque and beauty.</p>

    <p class="title">Growing Up</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and muscle fatigue and weakness that comes from the disintegrating collagen in my
        legs. I am an ambulatory wheelchair and cane user and there are some days I can't get out of bed at all due to
        the pain. The title "Growing Up" is inspired by my doctors telling me it will get better as I grow up, only for
        it to get worse. This piece is an attempt to show an invisible disability and the excruciating pain I experience
        everyday. This is a reminder that no matter what your health is currently, we all end up disabled together and
        should work to educate, accept, and lift up our disabled friends and family.</q>

    <h2>Emily Cavender</h2>

    <p class="about">Ominous Outlooks is an artist, educator, writer, and activist. Their work surrounds her experience
        with living
        with disabilities and it pushes for a more accessible and inclusive world.</p>

    <p class="title">We Are Here</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>This artwork is inspired by the strict abortion bans in Texas and the rising rates of sepsis and deaths due to
        child birth complications. Disabled women are 11 times more likely to die from childbirth. Texas women are here
        and we will not be silent.</q>

    <p class="title">Massive Monet: I Can Experience</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>This piece is inspired by my research on accessibility in museums. Things like hanging height, small walkways,
        and small print labels all create barriers to experiencing the art. The person I interviewed talked about how
        visiting the Monet water lilies exhibit, and it being something they will never forget. Due to the size of the
        paintings, she could finally see the the brushstrokes and patterns of the artwork up close.</q>

    <h2>Paul Bones</h2>

    <p class="about">Dr. Paul Bones is a multiply disabled professor of sociology and artist residing in Denton, TX. He
        works mostly with wood, and has a small business called 1508 Handcrafted.</p>

    <p class="title">Bad Mad Rep</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>I am a huge horror fan, but I also have several mental illnesses. Horror, more than any other genre, highlights
        mental (and physical) disabilities, but the representation it provides tends to be more stigmatizing than
        liberatory. This piece is a reminder of that fact.</q>

    <p class="title">Best Nap Machine</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>Being disabled is exhausting. Between the way one's disabled bodymind can cause tiredness and everyday
        interactions with ableism, naps are often necessary. This is designed to look like a professional wrestling
        championship belt, and was inspired by professional wrestler "The Best Bout Machine" Kenny Omega.</q>

    <p class="title">Get the Spray Bottle</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>This was inspired by the "horny jail" responses one finds on social media frequently, and encourages us to speak
        up when we encounter ableism in the world.</q>

    <p class="title">Disabled, Not Helpless</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>Disability is often equated with helplessness and a host of ideas that de-personalize disabled people. The piece
        challenges that idea.</q>

    <h2>Katherine Waddell</h2>

    <p class="about">Katherine is a multidisciplinary artist creating works focused on their experiences as a
        neurodivergent,
        disabled, and queer individual, primarily under the brand name Faul Magic.</p>

    <p class="title">The invisible cost (of food allergies)</p>
    <p class="question">What inspired this piece?</p>

    <q>I wanted to give the viewer of this piece the same sense of overwhelm I feel everyday when grocery shopping. It
        is difficult navigating food, medication, and even toiletries when you have major allergies that can be life or
        death such as being allergic to gluten or any of the other major allergens. It can also be difficult to know
        what claims and certifications to trust on food labels as there is not nearly enough regulation around any of
        it.</q>
